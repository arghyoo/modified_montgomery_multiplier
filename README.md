# modified_montgomery_multiplier
Project based on motgomery modular multiplier.
The proposed design addresses three distinct long integer multiplication operations: a 256 × 256-bit multiplication, a 258 × 258-bit multiplication, and a 258 × 255-
bit multiplication. For the first and third multipliers, complete results are required, whereas only a partial result is necessary for the second multiplier. All the multipliers are borken down recursively and with a base optimized multiplier being used.
